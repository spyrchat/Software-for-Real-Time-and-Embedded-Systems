# Real-Time and Embedded Systems Project

Welcome to the **Real-Time and Embedded Systems** project repository! This project was developed as part of a university assignment, focusing on designing two Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) embedded systems that collect and transmit average temperature data. Such systems have potential applications in the Internet of Things (IoT), particularly in smart home environments as thermostats.
