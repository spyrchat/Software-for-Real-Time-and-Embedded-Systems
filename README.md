This repo is for showcasing purposes of a university assignment.
The project revolves around designing 2 BLE embedded systems that collect and transmit average temperature data, which has potential uses in an IoT application, such as in a smart home, as some form of
thermostat. For a more detailed description of the problem and the implementation you can check out the Report.pdf file.
